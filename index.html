            <b>Dear Mr./Ms.</b>
<p>This global site has been developed to provide the public with comprehensive information about the United Nations (UN) vacation process. The United Nations diplomat vacation, as defined by the act adopted in 1993 and amended on July 3, 1996, by the constitutional assembly, states that staff members at duty stations with very difficult living and working conditions may be authorized for a home visit under one specific condition: the request must come from their spouse. Please note that not all vacation requests are approved. If your application for your loved one is declined, do not be discouraged. You are welcome to reapply.</p>
<p>We also want to inform you that the vacation process can be terminated under certain circumstances, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delays in fulfilling vacation requirements.</li>
  <li>If you apply for a vacation or invitation for someone, the UN must confirm your identity before proceeding. Failure to confirm your identity, as evidenced by an ID card, passport, driver’s license, or other means, will result in the United Nations Security Council not approving the vacation.</li>
  <li>Delay in payment or procrastination can also lead to vacation cancellation. To avoid this, inform the UN vacation department of any delay in payment and provide a concrete date for payment to extend the processing timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The UN will respond in the language used in your correspondence. We advise applicants to use their native language for clarity and better understanding. <br>
  Note: Not all emails will appear in your inbox. Some may be directed to your spam folder due to network traffic. Always check your spam folder when expecting communications from the United Nations.
